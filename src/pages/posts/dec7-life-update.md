<h1 id="interesting-things-i-did-in-the-week-of-30-november">Interesting
Things I Did in the Week of 30 November</h1>
<p>This is going to be very unstructured and rambling, but I figured my
blog is a good place to document my learning/reading journey. 99% of
this will probably be uninteresting to readers, but I hope one or two of
the links here might pique someone’s curiosity. For people uninterested
in Indian politics, skip ahead to where I talk about other stuff
(there’s a big horizontal line sectioning it off). Also, fair warning
that the stuff on Indonesia is a bit grisly (cannibalism and ethnic
conflict). Now, jumping into news stuff I read this week…</p>
<p>On Monday, I read <a
href="https://theprint.in/india/appealed-to-3-cms-then-laid-down-arms-maoists-zonal-committee-member-surrenders-in-maharashtra/2794701/">this
short article</a> on the surrender of several Naxals in Maharashtra, and
the “related links” led me down an interesting path from there.</p>
<p><a
href="https://theprint.in/india/hidma-hunted-down-sonu-surrendered-devujee-in-focus-forces-close-in-as-maoists-face-march-deadline/2791722/">This
is a good article</a> on the problems facing the Communist Party of
India (Maoist) today. The author focuses on how the recent encounter
deaths of several leaders have led to a split among the remaining
leadership between those who wish to continue armed resistance and those
who want to surrender and pursue nonviolent means. The article also
touches on how some leaders are old or in poor health, and the younger
leaders have military expertise but no political talent, making it hard
to maintain internal unity and keep recruitment strong. This is a good
read for anyone interested in the future of the Naxal movement.</p>
<p>I liked <a
href="https://theprint.in/opinion/naxals-are-indian-citizens-ruthless-force-is-not-the-way-to-solve-the-problem/2495331/">this
opinion article</a> that advocated for a ceasefire and a more humane
approach to dealing with the Naxal movement. The article argues that
Naxals are Indian citizens and should be treated as such, especially in
light of the very real grievances that they hold against the state; the
author’s proposed solution is a ceasefire with promises of less harsh
punishment and rehabilitation for those who surrender, which strikes me
as a far better solution than the Home Ministry’s policy of forever
waging a brutal war of attrition against poor villagers in Chhattisgarh
and Odisha. The writer also makes an interesting point about how Amit
Shah’s 31 March 2026 deadline for ending the counterinsurgency operation
could increase the number of fake encounters and civilian deaths since
it puts pressure on the security forces to move faster than possible
when respecting the rules of engagement – I actually had not considered
this point until now. On a completely different note, the author of the
article, Prakash Singh, is interesting in his own right; he is a retired
IPS officer who served in his career as Director General of Police,
Chief of the Border Security Force, UP police, and Assam police, and
he’s written a few books on counterinsurgency and the Naxal movement.
Very cool discovery of an interesting person.</p>
<p><a
href="https://thewire.in/economy/is-indias-q2-gdp-surge-believable">This
is a good article</a> by Arun Kumar on problems with the Indian
government’s methodology for GDP calculation and why the IMF has
downgraded the quality of India’s GDP data to a C. I also read <a
href="https://thewire.in/labour/labour-codes-pushing-business-interests-in-the-name-of-labour-reform">Arun
Kumar’s article on the new Labour Codes</a> that makes good points about
how the Codes will exacerbate labour’s weaknesses in wage bargaining and
how they have the potential to worsen unemployment and hurt aggregate
demand.</p>
<p>The Arun Kumar article on Labour Codes led me to this <a
href="https://thewire.in/labour/explainer-what-do-the-labour-codes-mean-for-the-indian-worker">absolutely
brilliant article</a> that goes into even greater depth on the subject.
It explains what the Codes change and how they will end up hurting
workers. This is the most informative article I read this week, and I
HIGHLY recommend it to anyone interested in this topic since it explains
the procedural illegitimacy of the Codes (not consulting the Indian
Labour Conference or allowing debate), their reduction of workers’
bargaining power, and their potential to open the door to privatization
of state assets. There are a lot of good points discussed here, but one
of the most interesting numbers is that the new Industrial Relations
code has exempted companies with under 100 workers (used to be 300) from
needing government permission for retrenchment or closure, allowing 90%
of India’s companies to arbitrarily lay off workers en masse without
needing to coordinate with the government. The Occupational Safety and
Health Code similarly redefines ‘factory’ to exempt industrial units
with under 20 workers (used to be 10) from many government regulations,
encouraging companies to fragment their workforce to escape
compliance.</p>
<p>This is a <a
href="https://thewire.in/caste/nanded-caste-related-killing-police-arrest-five-including-partners-family">tragic
article</a> on the recent murder of Saksham Tate, a 20-year-old Dalit
man, in Nanded at the hands of his in-laws who refused to accept their
daughter’s intercaste marriage. Saksham Tate was reportedly shot in the
chest and then hit on the head with a tile by his wife’s brother; five
of her relatives are now in police custody in connection with the
case.</p>
<p>This was a <a
href="https://theprint.in/opinion/qatar-museum-mf-husain-legacy-beyond-his-life/2795112/">really
cool article</a> on a new MF Husain museum in Qatar, built exactly how
he had asked for it.</p>
<p>This was a <a
href="https://theprint.in/opinion/blaming-macaulay-for-indias-failures-is-just-lazy-politics-weve-perfected-since-1947/2793715/">good
opinion article</a> on Macaulay that argues that he was a force for good
in India, reducing emphasis on traditional Sanskrit education that had
little value and introducing the country to European literature. Shankar
Sharan does a good job of refuting lies about Macaulay, proving that
Macaulay didn’t forbid Indians from pursuing Sanskrit education if they
so wished but merely removed British promotion of it. The article
concedes that Macaulay was misguided in seeing Indian literature as
being so worthless but defends the fact that Macaulay truly wanted what
was best for education in India and that he did succeed in improving the
system. An important read, considering how our politicians are still
using the long-dead Macaulay as a bogeyman for the inadequacy of our
education system and a half-imagined problem of being over-dependent on
the western world. That article on Macaulay’s influence on the education
system led me to <a
href="https://theprint.in/opinion/why-dalits-love-mahatma-macaulay/2788225/">another
good article</a> praising Macaulay’s criticism of the caste system and
his vision of a freer India; I learned a lot from this one, especially
about Macaulay’s insistence on giving Dalit children equal access to
education and his belief that “no native of our Indian empire shall, by
reason of his colour, his descent, or his religion, be incapable of
holding office.” This quote from Macaulay was also quite powerful</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It would be, on the most selfish view of the case, far better for us
that the people of India were well governed and independent of us, than
ill governed and subject to us; that they were ruled by their own kings,
but wearing our broadcloth, and working with our cutlery, than that they
were performing their salams to English collectors and English
magistrates, but were too ignorant to value, or too poor to buy, English
manufactures. To trade with civilised men is infinitely more profitable
than to govern savages.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This was <a
href="https://theprint.in/opinion/political-mk-gandhi-failed-caused-harm-gave-congress-its-tradition-of-backseat-driving/2755327/">another
good article</a> by Shankar Sharan that argues MK Gandhi was the origin
of Congress’ tradition of ‘backseat driving’ and lack of respect for
democratic process within the party (<em>cough cough</em>, dynasty rule
and going out of their way to avoid criticism of the party
leadership).</p>
<p>Here’s a <a
href="https://theprint.in/opinion/modi-bengal-bihar-five-reasons/2791523/">good
article</a> by a TMC MP on why the BJP won’t win Bengal as easily as
they won Bihar. The author conveniently structures the article to have
five main points: the BJP’s lack of a well-loved leader in Bengal (the
“Nitish factor”), the TMC’s popularity among women, fewer problems with
law and order, a stronger economy, and a “bhadralok culture” that makes
it harder for the BJP’s Hindutva rhetoric to destroy the Bengali
tradition of cosmopolitanism. I’m a bit doubtful of the claim about the
economy and the last claim since bhadralok culture is sadly fading in
Bengal, but the other three are strong arguments.</p>
<p>This is a <a
href="https://www.outlookindia.com/national/jk-police-crackdown-books-banned-jamat-literature-seized">good
article</a> on book banning in Kashmir and how it goes against basic
principles of free expression in India. Some of the most interesting
points made here are that some of the banned literature consists of
books that are almost entirely reproductions of government documents
(what secessionist thought are they fighting there?) and that the police
are often seizing books that aren’t even on the official list of banned
books.</p>
<p>Sanjeev Chopra wrote a <a
href="https://theprint.in/opinion/china-prema-wangjom-thongdok-arunachal-pradesh/2796014/">good
article</a> on the history of India-China relations and the start of how
everything went downhill. Further cements my opinion that a lot of
trouble would’ve been avoided if Vallabhbhai Patel hadn’t died so early,
article shows he was much more clear-eyed than Nehru on the threat from
China. This is <a
href="https://theprint.in/opinion/security-code/india-china-conflict-began-in-1947-not-1962-war-its-lessons-still-haunt-new-delhi/2727845/">another
good article</a> on that bit of history.</p>
<p>And then the <a
href="https://theprint.in/politics/battered-by-defeat-lack-of-coordination-congress-rjd-alliance-unravels-in-bihar/2797177/">latest
episode</a> in the Bihar assembly election saga: even after losing the
actual election, the Mahagathbandhan continues to lose haha. This time,
it’s the Rashtriya Janata Dal and Congress blaming each other for the
loss and making rash statements threatening to end the alliance. The
only hope is that Jan Suraaj can take both parties’ vote share rather
than the NDA gobbling it up.</p>
<p>Now here’s some <a
href="https://thewire.in/law/hany-babu-gets-bail-after-five-years-and-four-months-in-jail-without-trial">good
news</a> – Hany Babu has finally been released on bail after 5 years and
4 months without trial in connection with the Bhima Koregaon case.
Horrible that it took so long, but at least the court finally realized
the insanity of what the NIA was doing. The article on his release
mentioned that he’d written some articles from The Wire while in prison,
so out of curiosity I opened <a
href="https://thewire.in/rights/how-long-is-too-long-undertrial-detention">this
article</a> on how the law tackles the topic of undertrial detention. It
was an INCREDIBLE read with some of the best legal analysis I’ve seen, I
highly recommend it to anyone interested in the subject. Fun fact, a
suspect can be kept in undertrial detention (without conviction) for up
to half the maximum jail sentence for the crime they’re accused of; for
crimes where the punishment can be life imprisonment or the death
sentence, there is no such “half ground” limit, creating a system where
undertrial prisoners are effectively assumed “guilty until proven
innocent.” This is one of the most shameful parts of the Indian legal
system and is worth learning about.</p>
<p>Here is some of the <a
href="https://thewire.in/rights/dangerous-precedent-former-judges-senior-lawyers-write-to-cji-over-his-remarks-on-rohingyas">first
bad news to emerge</a> about the character of the new Chief Justice of
India. In a habeas corpus case over the custodial disappearance of five
Rohingya illegal immigrants, CJI Surya Kant said</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Once these illegal migrants are in India, they claim right to food
and shelter and help for their children. We have many poor people in the
country. They have a right over the country’s resources, not the illegal
migrants.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Would be nice if the CJI was a bit more concerned by the state’s
complete disregard for due process in deportations, rather than making
non sequiturs trying to justify depriving migrants of food and
shelter.</p>
<p>Here’s some <a
href="https://theprint.in/opinion/bangladeshs-political-reality-has-shifted-new-survey-show-70-approve-of-interim-govt/2798592/">interesting
data</a> on how Bangladeshis feel about their political system. An
International Republican Institue (IRI) survey of 3270 “likely voters”
found that 33% would vote for the Bangladesh National Party (BNP) and
29% for Jamaat e Islami. There’s lots more interesting survey results in
the <a
href="https://www.iri.org/resources/national-survey-of-bangladesh-september-october-2025/">full
IRI report here</a>. I’m sad that there’s no grassroots opposition
movement against both the BNP and Jamaat, since both of them have a very
dark past, but it’s too late for any new party to reach their scale
between now and February. Let’s see if “the Dark Prince” (who seems
likely to come back to power) truly has changed his ways…</p>
<p>Here’s a <a
href="https://thewire.in/government/as-portal-falters-lakhs-of-waqf-properties-remain-unregistered-opposition-mps-demand-deadline-extension">good
article</a> on the status of the Waqf property registration portal; the
website is down most of the time, arbitrarily deletes half-entered data,
and crashes off and on, but the BJP government still refused to extend
the December 5 deadline for registration. Only on December 5,
<em>literally the deadline for registration</em>, did the minority
affairs minister tell people that there would be no fines or penalties
for the next 3 months against people who didn’t register before the
deadline. Classic example of BJP’s chaotic and callous governance
style.</p>
<p>And then the latest of the BJP government in Arunachal Pradesh. <a
href="https://thewire.in/law/remarkable-coincidence-shows-cartelisation-sc-on-work-contracts-awarded-to-arunachal-cms-relatives">This
article</a> summarizes the Supreme Court’s recent findings on the
‘cartelisation’ (words of Justice Vikram Nath) of work contract awards;
turns out that companies owned by BJP Chief Minister Pema Khandu and his
family are awarded work contracts even when they give a tender just
0.01% less than competing companies’ tenders, and there are concerns
over whether competing companies are even allowed to participate in the
tender process. Also interesting is <a
href="https://thewire.in/politics/arunachal-bjp-minister-says-panchayat-seats-where-bjp-loses-wont-get-govt-schemes">this
article</a> on remarks recently made by Ojing Tasing, the state’s
panchayats and rural development minister. He has threatened to not
provide access to government welfare schemes to panchayat seats that
don’t elect BJP candidates. His exact words were</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I don’t believe in beating around the bush. The panchayat segments
where the BJP candidates lose will not get any scheme. As the panchayati
raj minister, I mean what I say</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>Yikes</em></p>
<hr />
<p>Moving away from the topic of politics, I have finished Aakar Patel’s
“The Price of the Modi Years” (great book) and have now started Richard
Lloyd Parry’s “In the Time of Madness.” It’s an amazing book, and I’m
learning a lot. I won’t go super in depth (saving that for a proper book
review), but I’ll briefly talk about what I’ve been liking so far. Parry
writes really well and has some incredible experiences that he talks
about in the book. The first section on the West Borneo headhunting wars
introduced me to a bit of history I had never even heard about before;
the ethnic violence between the Dayaks and Madurese is one of the
darkest chapters in human history, and there’s no comparable conflict
through which to try understanding it. The Dayaks would kill Madurese,
eat their hearts, and then ritually decapitate them and mutilate the
head, believing this ritual cannibalism brought them magic powers.
Parry’s book is deeply informative and transported me to a world of
unimaginable horror, where he forced me to think about the question
of:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>How poor an existence these people had, that this hairy lump [a
severed human head] on an oil drum should be an emblem of morality and
hope</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Parry also has a talent for good turn of phrase, and it’s almost
addictive to read his book. His prose brings the jungles of West Borneo
to life and is immensely satisfying to read.</p>
<p>He’s also good at guessing which factoids will be most interesting to
readers, presenting a wealth of knowledge on the Dayaks’ beliefs in
black magic and the reasons for hatred between the Dayaks and the
Madurese. It’s also nice how Parry adds bits of dark humor to make this
otherwise depressing book a bit less heavy. The humor is still very
dark, but there’s a kind of very sick irony in some parts such as this
one</p>
<blockquote>
<p>My idea was to take a shot from behind. There would be no doubt what
was depicted – the head of a decapitated man on an oil drum – but
without the slashed mouth and lidless eyes, and the ribbons of tissue
trailing from the neck. I had knelt down and was raising the camera,
when the younger of the brothers spotted what I was doing. He raised his
hand, ran forward, then picked up the head and turned it round through
180 degrees to face me. I walked round to the other side, and tried
again. The same thing happened. The boy was trying to be helpful. He
couldn’t understand why I should avoid the face of the dead man. He
wanted to give me the very best view of this magical object that was
bringing him and his brother so much excitement and delight.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It’s also interesting to see Parry’s more personal reflections on how
he was impacted by what he was seeing. He’s incredibly open about his
feelings at the time, and that makes the book even more immersive as
we’re able to try imagining what was going through his head as he
reported on the conflict.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I had never worked in such conditions before, and nor had anyone I
knew. The experience produced two contradictory reactions. The first was
relief, together with a guilty pride, in finding myself able to confront
horror without being overcome by nausea or fear. The second reaction
took the form of troubling questions, which nagged me at odd moments.
Why was I not more upset by this? What was wrong with me? I don’t know
what to call such an emotion, but it is something close to shame.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I finished the first part on the West Borneo ethnic violence and am
almost through the section on the Jakarta riots and the fall of Suharto.
The second section is somehow even more informative than the first one,
and I started writing down some of the things I read because they piqued
my curiosity enough to google them later. Parry makes the entire history
of Indonesia seem fascinating, creating an organized framework through
which to view much of the history while also presenting the chaos of the
inexplicable parts. I learned a lot about the Suharto era and its
lasting impact on Indonesia, presented both through historical evidence
and Parry’s talent for metaphor</p>
<blockquote>
<p>During his presidency, every public and private office in Indonesia
carried a pair of photographic portraits: the president, twinned with
the vice-president of the moment. In the space of a few months,
Suharto’s image had been removed to leave only that of Habibie. But all
over the country, he survived, and in appropriately ghostly form. In
companies, schools, government offices, even in some private homes,
telltale picture hooks still protruded where Suharto once hung, above
unfaded rectangles of fresh-looking paint.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>What really caught my attention about Suharto was how <em>weird</em>
he was – I feel like Elias Canetti or Ashis Nandy would’ve had a lot of
fun psychoanalyzing him. He held power for over 30 years, yet he didn’t
live a very lavish lifestyle, choosing to live in a middle class home
rather than a palace, and he didn’t establish a cult of personality
either – which begs the question, why did he take power in the first
place? He laughed at superstitions when meeting western leaders, yet in
Indonesia, he encouraged superstitions about the divine source of his
power; some of the more interesting theories are that he derived his
power from his marriage to Ibu Tien, who was a descendant of the royal
house of Solo, and the belief that he wasn’t killed in the 1965 Gestapu
coup because a seer advised him to spend the night “at the confluence of
two waters,” which convinced him to go fishing that day. No one is sure
if Suharto’s beliefs in Javanese mysticism were genuine or just a
political tool to win the approval of a superstitious population. That
entire period of history is a fascinating mystery.</p>
<p>The Javanese conception of power was also very cool to read about.
Similar to the Chinese Mandate of Heaven, the Javanese believe in the
“wahyu,” a divine right to rule that can come in many forms. Parry told
many interesting stories of how, even in the 1990s, these beliefs held
sway, and protestors would often talk to him about how they had seen the
wahyu flying through the sky towards an opposition leader’s house a few
days before the start of the Jakarta riots. It’s fascinating how kings,
and later on politicians, had to combine their military support with the
people’s belief in their divine right to rule, even in the 20th
century.</p>
<p>Another nice feature of the book is how it’s structured around some
central themes: “Something Close to Shame” is on his complex reaction to
seeing the headhunting in west Borneo, and the entire book “In the Time
of Madness” is organized around the idea of the “Time of Madness”
prophesied in the Prelambang Jayabaya, a 12th century Javanese prophecy,
being upon us. It adds an oddly poetic character to the book.</p>
<p>Overall, I was awed by how much history Parry had managed to see, and
I’ve learnt a ton about the history and culture of Indonesia because of
this book. I 10/10 recommend it, based on the 100-something pages I’ve
read so far. Incredible to hear the first-hand account of a British
journalist witnessing cannibalism in west Borneo, or wandering the
Indonesian parliament building the day that protestors were allowed in
to stage a demonstration. He’s a great writer with some fascinating
stories to tell.</p>

<p>In the world of film, I’ve seen two movies recently: “The Act of
Killing” and “A Death in the Gunj.” Both were really good, but I’m going
to write about them later on since it’s past midnight now and I don’t
want too much overlap between this post and later film reviews (coming
eventually haha).</p>
<p>In the world of music, I’ve recently gotten addicted to A.R. Rahman’s
song “Dil Se Re” (really good) and “Mist/Fog” from Park Chan-wook’s
“Decision To Leave,” while still being addicted (for about a month now)
to “Imi Oneun Sori” from Park Chan-wook’s film “The Handmaiden” – just
goes to show how good he is at selecting music for his movies haha. I
recommend these songs, very good music.</p>
<p>I haven’t discovered too much new music last week, mainly due to
laziness about listening to new albums and instead putting Park
Chan-wook film soundtracks on repeat, so I’ll hopefully get some new
favorites this week.</p>

<p>Well, that sums up this post. Sorry for the rambling nature of it,
but writing a structured post takes an obscene amount of time and I hope
this is interesting(?). As always, feel free to message me on discord at

<code>chancellorceti &lt;at&gt; gmail.com</code> to talk about anything
you found interesting here.</p>
<p>Thanks for reading !!!!!!!!</p>
