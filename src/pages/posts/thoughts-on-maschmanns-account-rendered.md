Thoughts on Melita Maschmann’s “Account Rendered: A Dossier On My Former
Self”</h1>
<p>I’m going to preface this book review by saying that I do draw some
connections here between Nazi Germany and current-day political
movements. I am at no point trying to trivialize the atrocities
committed by Nazi Germany or compare their magnitude to anything being
done today, but it is important to notice that there are similarities in
how Nazism took root in Germany and how similar extremist ideologies
gain support today. I am attempting to draw lessons from the past here,
and I am not trying to equate the atrocities of Nazi Germany with
anything being done today. This is a common accusation leveled against
articles on this topic, so I thought I should include this explanation;
apologies for the length. With that out of the way, onwards with the
actual book review.</p>
<p>“Account Rendered” was written by Melita Maschmann, a former Nazi who
became one of the rare success stories of denazification; this book is
the story of her ideological and personal development, starting from her
early childhood and ending in the aftermath of World War 2 as she
finally realizes the inhumanity of National Socialism and recants her
beliefs. Maschmann gives an incredible analysis of National Socialism
and the cultural factors that helped supplant it in the minds of so many
of the German people, including herself, while also helping us
understand the mechanisms through which complete indoctrination can
slowly be fought against.</p>
<p>The most interesting aspect of her story is how ‘normal’ she was; she
was born into a slightly conservative middle-class family, and,
throughout the book, she demonstrates the capacity for critical
judgement of authorities, appreciation for literature, and compassion
towards others. None of these would make her mind seem like fertile
ground for the seeds of Nazism, and yet she did become infatuated with
the racist and antisemitic ideology of Hitler. This book is a
fascinating read because it reveals how ordinary, middle-class people
can fall prey to political radicalization with devastating
consequences.</p>
<p>I don’t want to spoil the entire book, but I will list some of the
more interesting factors in her radicalization to give an idea of what
the book is about.</p>
<p>The first factor she mentioned was her view of National Socialism as
a foil to her parents’ bourgeois values; she cites “a rebelliousness
that went beyond the purely personal rebellion of adolescence and was
directed against the bourgeois values which my parents represented.”
Having grown up under strict parenting, she spent her teenage years
looking for ways to rebel and assert her own identity, distinct from
that of her parents; National Socialism, which exalted the German
peasantry and spoke of a “National Community” of all Germans, seemed the
perfect route through which to satiate this teenage thirst to be
different from one’s parents.</p>
<p>This idea is interesting for two reasons.</p>
<p>Firstly, the teenage tendency towards rebellion is a universal
phenomenon, and I was struck by how Maschmann’s story demonstrates the
susceptibility of anyone, regardless of their background or education,
to political radicalization. She was driven towards Hitler by factors
that could affect anybody, regardless of time or place.</p>
<p>Secondly, this factor is interesting because it reveals the broader
theme of how National Socialism gained popularity among many of the more
rational Germans by downplaying the antisemitic aspects and emphasizing
the desire to rebuild Germany and improve the lives of the poor. This is
a constant theme throughout the text; the very name “National Socialism”
shows how Nazism succeeded by merging its nationalism and antisemitism
with just enough of a socialist veneer to appeal to left-leaning members
of the middle class, who would otherwise find Hitler’s fanaticism
absurd. Maschmann comments throughout the book on how she found the
education on scientific racism comical and poorly thought-out; Nazism
gained popularity among putatively more rational parts of the middle
class because it hid its ugliest characteristics under the guise of
serving the ‘National Community.’</p>
<p>Maschmann herself avoided the most violent and sinister parts of Nazi
Germany’s state apparatus, working mainly in the propaganda division and
the labor service. Maschmann’s work in the labor service was another
factor in her support for Hitler that again ties into this theme of
obscuring violent fanaticism beneath a guise of community service and
patriotism. She spent a long time in the labor service and reflected
throughout the book on how it shaped her opinion of National Socialism.
Her work required her to help poor German farmers settle newly annexed
Polish land, assisting with agricultural work but also taking care of
sick children, helping pregnant women prepare for childbirth, and
organizing funerals. Maschmann’s work in the labor service bolstered her
belief that National Socialism focused on the benefit of the German poor
and that antisemitism and racism were just peripheral components of the
ideology.</p>
<p>Despite the labor service showing the community service aspect of
National Socialism, she still encountered evidence of Nazism’s
inhumanity with increasing frequency – so how did she avoid confronting
that evidence and recognizing Nazism for what it was? She constantly
emphasizes that the reason her support for Hitler lasted so long was
because she trained herself to just not question the most evil things
she was witnessing; a big part of the book focuses on how it’s possible
for people to so completely shut down some parts of their mind</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A person who has never lived under the tutelage of an ‘ideology’ will
find it hard to understand how it is possible for such pressing
questions not to be asked.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>She found a few explanations for her indifference to the atrocities
she witnessed and her unquestioning obeisance to National Socialism. She
rationalized to herself the cruelty towards the Poles by thinking of the
violence unleashed by the Polish partisans and convincing herself that
different standards apply during a war.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The war had started. Since I had seen the sufferings of the German
community, some of whom had been killed by the Poles, I believed I had
learned that one must harden oneself against the sight of human
suffering.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>After the Kristallnacht, she justified the pogrom by remembering her
ideological training that taught her that Jews were the enemies of
Germany. This rationalization is interesting because Maschmann herself
admitted that the antisemitic and racist components of the ideological
training seemed the most ridiculous; she did not see the vilification of
Jews as a vital component of National Socialism that she should
wholeheartedly support, but rather as a convenient way of avoiding
intellectual confrontation with the insane inhumanity staring her in the
face. Maschmann’s support of Hitler, throughout the book, has very
little to do with the parts of his agenda focusing on the persecution of
Jews, homosexuals, or disabled people; she supported Hitler because she
believed he was avenging the injustice done to Germany by the Treaty of
Versailles, restoring Germany to its ‘rightful place,’ and improving the
lot of the poor. She avoided the facts of the regime’s evil through the
crude justifications discussed here.</p>
<p>The true horror of this book isn’t that Maschmann was herself cruel
or violent, it is that she so completely closed off her mind to
confronting the reality around her and found so many ways of
rationalizing to herself the cruelty of the Nazis. Even though this
wilful ignorance is disturbing to read about, it is important to read
this book and see how it came about. Maschmann had Jewish friends even
during her early days in the Hitler Youth and saw them as good people;
it was Hitler’s dehumanization of Jews in his rhetoric and his framing
of them as an evil ‘other,’ separate from the Jews that Maschmann
actually saw day-to-day, that allowed Maschmann and countless others to
reconcile antisemitism with their own positive relations with Jewish
friends and neighbors. She finally cut ties with her Jewish friends not
out of hatred for them but rather seeing it as a slightly unfortunate
but necessary step to complete her full entry into the sphere of
National Socialism.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>There was only one thing that made me glad to leave Berlin. In this
way I could allow my friendship with you [addressed to one of her Jewish
friends] and your family to fade away. I wanted to avoid the open
breach, which — after years of evading the conflict — I nevertheless
felt to be my duty, because one could only do one of two things: either
have Jewish friends or be a National Socialist.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>In preaching that all the misery of the nations was due to the Jews
or that the Jewish spirit was seditious and Jewish blood was corrupting,
I was not compelled to think of you or old Herr Lewy or Rosel Cohn: I
thought only of the bogey- man, ‘the Jew’. And when I heard that the
Jews were being driven from their professions and homes and imprisoned
in ghettos, the points switched automatically in my mind to steer me
round the thought that such a fate could also overtake you or old Lewy.
It was only the Jew who was being persecuted and ‘made harmless’.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Taken as a whole, Maschmann’s account presents many powerful lessons
on how fascist ideologies take root within a population; in her case, it
seems to be, among other things, a combination of something new and
different appealing to teenage rebelliousness, a veneer of patriotism
and community service concealing the violent racism, and rhetoric that
treated Jews as a monolithic evil separate from individual people, as
well as the idea that the standards of basic humanity change during a
war.</p>
<p>This book has special relevance today as the politics of hate again
becomes mainstream in many corners of the world. Maschmann’s experience
proves that nobody is completely immune to propaganda and
radicalization; already, we are seeing rational human beings lend their
support to authoritarian regimes with vague promises to “Make America
Great Again” or bring “Acche Din” (good days) to India. Maschmann’s book
serves as a way of better understanding the current times and also
remaining vigilant so that we ourselves do not fall prey to such
radicalization, better aware of the mechanisms by which such poisonous
ideas enter our minds. It is an essential read for anyone hoping to
avoid repeating the mistakes of the past and save the 21st century from
a resurgence of politics rooted in hate and fear.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>That is what I should like to say to every good person. Not with the
implication: ‘Your goodness has feet of clay just as much as mine had’,
but rather to implore him: ‘Be on your guard.’ Take warning. There is
nowhere any good thing — however worthy of respect it may seem — which
one may serve with the means of evil (that is of lovelessness).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>However, Maschmann does not just end with an ominous warning. She
also describes her slow disillusionment and eventual abandonment of
National Socialism. Many of the key steps come from the gradual
destruction of Germany and the dream she believed she was fighting for:
crawling out of a cellar, the only person alive after thirty people
including her parents suffocated or burned to death during a bombing
raid; hearing the leader of the Hitler Youth confess to having sent
children to fight and die in the defense of Berlin; and finally coming
to terms with the defeat of Germany in World War 2, the slaughter of six
million Jews, and the inhumanity of the regime she had spent years
supporting.</p>
<p>The pessimistic interpretation of her story is that the only way to
combat political radicalization is waiting for it to run its course and
inevitably end in tragedy. However, Maschmann also highlights cases
where, even at the peak of Hitler’s power and the persecution of his
political opponents, some incredibly brave and clear-eyed individuals
tried to convince her that National Socialism was the wrong path for
Germany. While she did not heed their warnings at the time, she
remembered their words years later and then began to think about the
contradictions they had highlighted in the ideology of National
Socialism. After the end of World War 2 and Maschmann’s release from an
Allied Forces prison, her denazification was accelerated by honest
conversations about National Socialism, Christianity, and the last few
years of chaos and violence; she repeatedly noted that the people
guiding her away from Nazism had greater integrity and decency than the
leaders she had dealt with in the Nazi Party. Maschmann’s story teaches
us that open debate and challenging dogmatic thinking can play a crucial
role in combating political radicalization and blind faith in extremist
ideologies.</p>
<p>Maschmann also became more disillusioned with Nazism as she began to
read about the Holocaust, finally being forced to confront the evil of
the regime she had supported, and also as she thought critically about
how the works of classical German poets such as Hölderlin had been
crudely reinterpreted as support for Nazism. The final pages of
Maschmann’s book demonstrate the cruciality, even today, of encouraging
people to think carefully about everything they read or see and to be
aware of everything that goes on in the world, being aware of the
atrocities committed in the name of one’s preferred ideology. As we
again encounter the issue of political radicalization in the 21st
century, many valuable lessons can be drawn from “Account Rendered.”</p>
<p>Maschmann’s book offers a window into an important period of history
with many lessons to help us make a better world today; her clear prose
and remarkable capacity for self-reflection make this one of the most
important books for anyone looking to better understand the rise of
Hitler, the process of denazification, and the mechanisms by which
political radicalization takes place and can also be combated.</p>
