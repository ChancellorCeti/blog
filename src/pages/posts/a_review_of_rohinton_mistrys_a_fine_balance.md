<h1 id="a-review-of-rohinton-mistrys-a-fine-balance">A Review of
Rohinton Mistry’s “A Fine Balance”</h1>
<blockquote>
<p>“You see, you cannot draw lines and compartments, and refuse to budge
beyond them. Sometimes you have to use your failures as stepping-stones
to success. You have to maintain a fine balance between hope and
despair.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Rohinton Mistry’s 1995 novel “A Fine Balance” owes its title to the
idea of balancing hope and despair even in the darkest of times.
However, the word “fine” is an understatement – “precarious” is a better
word to describe that balance amidst the death and destruction of
Mistry’s world.</p>
<p>The book is set during the Emergency in India. For those unfamiliar
with Indian history, the Emergency was a period between 1975 and 1977
during which the prime minister Indira Gandhi declared a state of
emergency throughout the country to crack down on political opposition
and avoid the consequences of the Supreme Court convicting her of
electoral fraud. This was a terrifying time in India. Political
opponents were jailed and tortured, the poor were subjected to forced
sterilizations, and millions were displaced by slum demolitions in the name
of “city beautification.”</p>
<p>Mistry’s novel shows the impacts of the Emergency on the lives of
ordinary people living in an already cruel world.</p>
<p>The story centers around four characters from different backgrounds
who end up living together during the Emergency and developing a
powerful friendship: a widow struggling to make rent while still haunted
by the loss of her husband years ago; a college student coping with the
disappearance of his best friend, an activist who incurred the
government’s wrath; and two Dalits fleeing caste violence in their
village only to then meet the trials of poverty in the big city.</p>
<p>The book tackles Emergency-era India by taking us beyond the realm of
summaries and data tables and into the tents where men underwent forced
sterilizations and into the slums that were destroyed by Sanjay Gandhi’s
insanity. We see people’s lives, already dire, thrown overnight into
even greater turmoil by forces beyond their control. History is shown as
an unstoppable beast, destroying everything in its wake and leaving
ordinary people to maintain the fine balance between hope and despair,
even as the whole world is pitted against them. The book makes the
Emergency – resplendent in its injustice, its horrors, and its violence–
come to life, doing justice to the story of one of the darkest times
in India.</p>
<p>The book goes beyond the evils created by Indira Gandhi. Much of the
suffering in the novel isn’t related to the Emergency but rather to the
status quo prior to that added bit of hellfire. The squalid conditions
of the poor shown in this book existed prior to the Emergency and still
exist today. The injustice suffered by Dalits is similarly constant
throughout Indian history. Government corruption, at every level, is a
constant not just in Indian history but through all modern history. “A
Fine Balance” depicts life not only during the Emergency but
through all of post-Independence history, portraying problems that have
hounded us from 1947 to today.</p>
<p>In addition to the horrifying illustration of Emergency-era India,
Mistry’s novel beautifully captures the complexity of human
relationships. Mistry shows a father and son tragically drifting apart,
each one’s life being destroyed by their inability to reconcile, and a
Parsi girl fighting her brother for independence and control of her life
after the death of their father. The novel shows how people form
friendships in the strangest ways, united only by their shared struggle
and by the simplest acts of kindness, and how seemingly unbreakable
friendships are broken with the passage of time and the cruelty of the
world. The relationships shown in this book are realistic and offer a
powerful lesson about how, even in the terror of Indira Gandhi’s
Emergency, the connections between us can help maintain the fine balance
between hope and despair</p>
<p>Despite the serious topics tackled by this book, Mistry intersperses
all this doom and gloom with humor. He takes delight in highlighting the
most ridiculous parts of Indian politics and society. There is an entire
chapter dedicated to satirizing Indian political rallies. Mistry
describes buses rounding people up in a slum and taking them to attend a
political rally with the promise of tea and snacks. What follows is a
complete circus: ministers demonstrating exaggerated subservience to
their higher-ups, attendees hilariously uninterested in the speeches,
and grandiose stunts failing in the most ridiculous ways imaginable. An
eighty-foot cutout of Indira Gandhi fell on top of the crowd, with
security personnel comically struggling to keep it upright and attendees
scattering every direction, eliciting the following response from three
impassive onlookers</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Nobody wants to be caught in the Prime Minister’s embrace,” said
Rajaram.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>“But she tries to get on top of everyone,” said Om.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>“Shameless boy,” said his uncle.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Mistry takes the insanity of the world and turns it into irresistible
comedy.</p>
<p>The book is often reminiscent of “Lazarillo de Tormes” or “The Master
and Margarita” in its ridiculous yet macabre comedy. One feels sick for
laughing at certain scenes but can not help it, overcome by the
absurdity. A funeral procession of beggars – limping and crawling
according to their respective disabilities – is accompanied by a police
escort, often being left behind by pallbearers unused to the slow pace.
The occasion of the funeral is tragic, but the image so absurd that it
triggers laughter. In another scene, while squatting over train tracks,
a slum dweller philosophizes on the art of open-air defecation, earning
him the title “Goo Guru” among his students who are new to the
lifestyle. The absence of toilets and the filthiness of the slum is
terrible, but Mistry uses humor to maintain the fine balance even in
these unpleasant moments. He inserts his unique brand of morguehouse humor everywhere,
making us reluctantly smile even as the story gets darker and
darker.</p>
<p>The book’s prose is beautiful, making every part of the world come to life. Mistry gives us a sweeping
portrait of Emergency-era India, forcing us to see the victims as real
people like you or I. The suffering and the terror of the Emergency come
to life, leaving a haunting impact on even the bravest reader. Despite
the immense pain suffered by characters, Mistry’s novel, true to its
name, does show how we can maintain a fine balance, how joy can come out
of even the worst places. The novel demonstrates how friendship, a good
sense of humor, and well-made chapatis can help people balance hope
against despair, even as the world is unimaginably dark and cruel.</p>
