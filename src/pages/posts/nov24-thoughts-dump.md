<h1 id="an-update-on-my-life-venting-reading-films-and-music-dump">An
Update on My Life – Venting, Reading, Films, and Music Dump</h1>
<p>Since writing math and physics content takes an obscene amount of
time and inspiration that I currently lack, I thought I’d write a less
serious post for once – this will hopefully also satisfy the people who
tell me blog posts shouldn’t take half an hour to read.</p>
<p>So, recent developments – I am almost done with my college
applications! The bulk of the writing was in my first wave of
applications due December 1st, and I am on the verge of submitting
those, so I’m close to the end of my suffering. I’ll likely write
something at greater length about the process later on, but I’ll briefly
describe my most important complaints.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The writing style that colleges expect is sappy and
cringe-inducing. Most of the “exemplar” essays are atrocious, and I
would vomit if I ever wrote anything like them. The recommended format
makes it impossible to avoid this, since it’s asking kids to write
essays of the form “Object X symbolizes my life because <em>launch into
overly metaphorical cringe-inducing story of how beautiful your soul
is</em>.” Why are we encouraging kids on the cusp of adulthood to write
about how their stuffed animals represent different aspects of their
personality?? The exemplar essays are overly descriptive of irrelevant
details, packed with malfunctioning metaphors, and always cliché, which
brings me to point 2….</p></li>
<li><p>It’s impossible to avoid being cliché when your essay is one of
1000 that the admissions officer will see, and you’ve received the same
advice as the other 999 kids. We’re asked to “find our voice,” but none
of us are developed enough as writers that we have a distinctive writing
style the way Hemingway or V.S. Naipaul would. Which brings me to point
3…</p></li>
<li><p>The last 3 years of high school English classes have done nothing
to prepare us for this kind of writing. We have only worked on literary
analysis and rhetorical analysis, writing about how authors use
metaphors and similes to develop a theme, but we’ve never worked on
writing personal statements. This feels like a failure of the high
school curriculum that goes beyond college applications, since only 0.1%
of students will go into literary analysis… maybe some of this time
would’ve been better spent helping kids develop more basic but widely
applicable skills?</p></li>
<li><p>There’s also the issue of how repetitive the prompts are. There’s
a massive amount of overlap between different universities’ prompts, but
there’s always just <em>slightly</em> different enough that you can’t
copy-paste essays from other prompts. It feels like a huge waste of our
time.</p></li>
<li><p>The emphasis on extracurricular activities leads to the issue of
Linkedin resumé padding. A lot of things sound more impressive on paper
than they actually are. A few examples:</p>
<ul>
<li>Orchestra social media manager = posted a low-quality Tiktok once
every 3 months</li>
<li>Member of National Honor Society (NHS) = logged 10 hours of
volunteering every semester, often through a mix of fudging numbers and
forcing oneself to work just to put the “NHS” label on college
applications (as admitted by many people I personally know)</li>
<li>District champion at Python programming UIL = was the fastest at
translating pseudocode into Python code when competing against an army
of skids (yes this is what the Python programming UIL finals actually
were, feel free to laugh)</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>The use of GPA as a criterion for auto-admission in Texas schools
rewards cheating, grade inflation (in AP Physics C, a 40% turns into a
90% through “grade-banding”), and teachers’ favoritism. A large amount
of kids with top 6% GPA at my school are cheating on tests, by their own
admission. Even if GPA isn’t the deciding factor in admissions, it’s
further contributing to the current disaster.</p></li>
<li><p>SAT and ACT don’t reflect any kind of intelligence or even
competence in math and reading comprehension. The SAT now lets students
use Desmos, which allows them to find the solutions to equations without
actually doing any math. There can be a debate over whether a test of
7th grade algebra should factor into college admissions, but now the SAT
isn’t even testing kids’ knowledge of elementary algebra, let alone more
advanced topics.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Well, that’s that. As stressful as exams are, I now feel like a board
exam (JEE!!) would lead to a more meritocratic and efficient admissions
system than the current quagmire I’m wading through.</p>
<p>Apart from college applications, I’ve been suffering a great deal at
school lately, but that’s a separate story for another blog post; I feel
I have already dumped enough negativity here regarding college
applications.</p>
<p>On to the positive developments. My Thanksgiving break has started,
and I’m already down sick! Thankfully it isn’t anything too severe, but
I still find it irritating. I’ve mostly recovered and am now splitting
my time between a few activities. I’ve been feverishly reading Aakar
Patel’s “The Price of the Modi Years” and am learning about the last ten
years of disastrous governance under Modi. I’ll soon write a more
detailed post, but until then, did you know that former Chief Justice
Ranjan Gogoi once served on a bench investigating a sexual-harassment
case against himself? Or how about the fact that, in 2021, a RTI request
found that the Supreme Court had 54 pending habeas corpus petitions,
with the oldest dating back to 16 years before. Even more interestingly,
did you know that Justice Arun Mishra was on the bench judging the
Rubabbuddin Sheikh vs State Of Gujarat &amp; Ors case (where “ors”
included current home minister Amit Shah), despite having earlier
recused himself from the case? Many interesting things can be learnt
from Aakar Patel’s book…</p>
<p>I’ve also been slowly making progress through Syed Mujtaba Ali’s
“Deshe Bideshe” in the original bangla! My reading/writing skills in
bangla are nonexistent, so I’m very excited to be developing them. The
book is interesting, telling the story of his stay in Afghanistan with
some very beautiful language. He has a good sense of humor and a talent
for poetry, so I’m enjoying the book a lot even though it’s a difficult
read.</p>
<p>I’ve also begun reading Kazi Nazrul Islam’s poem “Bidrohi” and some
more of Sukanta Bhattacharya’s poetry. “Bidrohi” is an INCREDIBLE poem,
blending Hindu and Muslim religious imagery with terrifying metaphor to
create an exaltation of the pre-Independence rebel. There is an
especially good recitation here for anyone who is interested
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=29X1GFso6y0 I reread Sukanta
Bhattacharya’s poem “Ae Mahajibhon” (amazing poem), which I had read
with an English transliteration before but never in the Bangla script
until now, so that was also quite satisfying.</p>
<p>Today I started watching Sanjay Kak’s documentary “Jashn-e-Azadi.”
I’ve only watched Part 1 so far, but I’m already impressed by the film.
It opens by following a father as he looks for his son’s grave in the
“martyrs’ graveyard,” setting the tone for this sobering work of cinema,
and continues by exploring the violence and repression that rules
Kashmir. The phrase “cordon and search,” distant and intangible in a
book, becomes more real as the true violence of such operations is
revealed: burnt homes, civilians caught in the crossfire, extrajudicial
killings, and grieving families. Sanjay Kak takes a very lyrical
approach to documentary filmmaking and weaves poetry into his film, just
as he did in “Mati ke Laal.” The choice of ghazals beautifully reflects
Kashmiris’ own reflections on the nature of freedom and the horrors they
have witnessed. The film is titled “Jashn-e-Azadi,” meaning “celebration
of freedom,” and it is quite successful in exploring that topic – what
does freedom really mean in a state under martial law, where the Indian
constitution is slowly being forced upon them at the cost of tens of
thousands of lives? The end of Part 1 shows Srinagar on Independence
Day, where the only people celebrating in the streets are the soldiers,
guarded by a labyrinth of barbed wire and rooftops manned by snipers – a
powerful message about what kind of “freedom” is really being brought to
Kashmir.</p>
<p>I’m also hoping to read some of Roberto Bolaño’s “2666” and make
progress on learning Indonesian over the break, but I’m not sure how
much time will permit. Another goal was writing more over this break,
and this post has already made some progress towards that goal, so
hooray!</p>
<p>Switching tracks again – on a long drive I started listening to some
music I recently downloaded but hadn’t had the chance to listen to until
then, and I realized a lot of it was really good.</p>
<p>In the kpop world, I liked Nmixx’s album “Blue Valentine” and
TripleS’s album &lt;ASSEMBLE24&gt;. Not all the songs are amazing, but
there’s a decent number of good songs in both albums.</p>
<p>In the Hindi music world, I have fallen in love with the Gangs of
Wasseypur soundtrack (more on the film later). All of the songs worked
well in the context of the film – the goofy songs (e.g. “Tain Tain To
To”) worked when paired with specific parts of the film, creating
comedic effect and irony where necessary. However, some songs are
amazing even outside of the film’s context. In particular, I recommend
“Teri Keh Ke Lunga,” which has some incredible singing by Amit Trivedi
and a very dark, foreboding feeling; “Jiya Tu” which provides a good
laugh and a burst of energy; “Taar Bijli,” a mournful song with
beautiful vocals and some subtle political commentary embedded into the
lyrics; and “Loonga Loonga,” a song with good energy that also has some
good lyrics (“ae jawanon, garibi tod deti hai jo riske khaas hote hain!
aur paraye apne hote hai jab paise paas hote hain!”).</p>
<p>I watched a number of good films in the last week or two, and I hope
to write reviews for the following: “Gangs of Wasseypur”, “The
Handmaiden”, and “Jukti Takko Aar Gappo.” I also want to write a review
for V.S. Naipaul’s “A House For Mr. Biswas” because I finished reading
it very recently.</p>
<p>That’s about it for now. I will likely do more random brain dumps of
this sort in the future, since this kind of writing is very stress-free
and lets me get out a lot of thoughts and recent events in a very easy
format. Apologies to my readership of 3.28 people who might have found
this boring or too chaotic. If you did somehow end up liking one of the
films, poems, or songs mentioned here or something similar, feel free to
talk to me about it (contact info on the about page of my blog).</p>
