<h1 id="life-update-january-29th">Life Update For January 2026</h1>
<p>Hello! After the last two ‘serious posts,’ I figured it was time to
give a personal update again. A lot has happened over the last ~two
months, so as usual, this will be a rambling and poorly structured post.
I’ll start by griping about school and then transition to more
interesting content – sorry for the negative rant, but school is 31% of
my awake hours, so it takes up a proportionate share of my update.</p>
<p>The first major development is that I am now in the second semester
of my senior year (12th grade) of high school, which is great news
because I have no obligations or stress during this time. Colleges don’t
consider second semester grades for admission, and they don’t rescind an
admissions offer unless you’re failing half your classes or get
suspended for trying to set a toilet on fire. You can easily figure out
a class is populated by 12th graders by counting how many are asleep,
playing video games, or watching Youtube. As a result, I’ve got a bit
more free time during school hours now, which I’m devoting to reading
and studying languages.</p>
<p>However, I’m a ‘quasi-senior’ because I’m early graduating; half my
courses are full of 12th graders, the other half full of 11th graders.
While 12th graders have finished college applications and are now
sleeping through classes, 11th graders are doing the exact opposite,
averaging 4 hours of sleep every night because they’re just about to
start college applications. Given that I exist between these worlds, I
see a morbidly funny dichotomy between apathy and over-work, alternating
every 90 minutes as I change classes. I’m getting a kind of
‘half-senior, half-junior (11th grade)’ experience where I spend half
the day relaxing in senior-majority classes and the other half enduring
a barrage of tests in junior-majority classes. While it is better than
the fully stressful junior experience sans early graduation, it still is
a bit frustrating to be deprived of the full luxury experience.</p>
<p>The lack of stress is also something that I’m paradoxically
conflicted about. While it is nice to enjoy my own books at school, all
this free time exacerbates my previous irritation with having to attend
high school; if I’m going to spend these 8 hours reading my own stuff,
why did I have to show up here at all? I spend half the day reading
“China After Mao” and studying Indonesian, and I spend the other half
trying to tune out lectures and race through tests that no longer matter
because I’m in the second semester. The sheer pointlessness of the
second semester is a bit infuriating, like a kind of spiritual prison.
My life is put on pause, and I’m unable to advance in my main career
progression through college courses that will actually serve a purpose
in my life; instead, I’m just killing time, waiting to leave 12th grade
and enter college where my courses (and the 8 hours they occupy)
actually contribute to my life. Something feels wrong about condemning
kids to 8 hours of school when the courses and exams no longer matter,
and the only reason for showing up is to get marked on the attendance
sheet and keep grades above a 70 to prevent admissions offers being
rescinded.</p>
<p>School is doubly frustrating for me because I’ve really started to
dislike the culture here. A lot of people enjoy senior year because it’s
more time to hang out with their friends, but I have no strong
friendships at school. I occasionally had good conversations with other
juniors last year, but since they’re all busy prepping for college
applications, I’m increasingly deprived of even these chance encounters.
Leaving aside those rare kids who are fun to talk to, most of the
conversations at school consist of inane brainrot (67 and skibidi
toilet), exchanging information about tests (technically not allowed but
academic integrity is a joke), or gossiping. Since none of these
interest me much, I’ve been left without much of a social life.</p>
<p>There’s a lot of other stuff I dislike about the school, the classes,
and the kids here, but I’m omitting it to avoid the risk of sounding
like a misanthropic crybaby. The social life problems are probably my
fault to some extent, so I don’t want to sound completely insane by
rambling on about that for several paragraphs. I’ll summarize all of
that ranting with a quick “I hate this place and can’t wait to get out
of here.”</p>
<p>With that update on school out of the way, onto more interesting
things!</p>
<hr />
<p>Outside of loneliness and frustration with school’s pointlessness, my
life has been going pretty well. I’ve finished three amazing books this
month, thanks in part due to the extra reading time at school. They are
“The Jakarta Method” by Vincent Bevins, “We Do Not Part” by Han Kang,
and “From Heaven Lake” by Vikram Seth. I hope to finish book reviews for
all of them in the next few days and post them on my blog, so I’ll
abstain from yapping about them here and save my thoughts for those
posts.</p>
<p>I’ve now started Frank Dikötter’s “China After Mao,” which I’m
already loving. This book is a history of China after Mao (surprise)
from 1976 to 2012, focusing on political and economic transformations.
I’ve been drawn in by the level of detail and the complexity of the
narrative he presents; rather than framing it as a well-calculated rise
to being a superpower, Dikötter portrays China’s rise as being chaotic,
prone to frequent halts, and plagued by a failure to bring about true
political or economic liberalization. After finishing just the first
chapter, I feel delightfully overwhelmed by information; the political
machinations of the Politburo members and the disastrous pendulum of
economic policy create reading that’s both informative and
entertaining.</p>
<p>If you want a month-by-month replay of the events leading up to and
following Deng Xiaoping’s rehabilitation in 1977, this is the book for
you. If you want a riveting story of seesawing between centralized
control of the economy and devolution of planning powers, with the chaos
that it created, this is the book for you. If you want to learn about
how flattery of American diplomats, vying for ‘Most Favoured Nation’
status with the US, and other diplomatic intrigue shaped our world
today, this is the book for you. If you just want to learn a ton about
post-Mao China and engage with interesting ideas, this is the book for
you.</p>
<p>I’ve also been working on learning more Indonesian, Spanish, and
Bengali, and I’ve started again trying to learn Mandarin. The juggling
of so many projects likely limits my progress in each of them, but I
don’t really care since I’m doing this for fun and am enjoying myself a
lot. I also have enough time that multitasking hasn’t significantly
limited me, so I’m satisfied with my current pace of progress.</p>
<p>In Indonesian and Mandarin, I’m learning from the ground up and just
starting to form basic sentences, but I’m able to consume more
interesting content in Spanish and Bengali due to my higher degree of
fluency. I’m technically already ‘fluent’ in Bengali, but I can only
speak in an informal register and I lapse into English when discussing
complex topics. I’ve therefore started pushing myself to learn the more
formal vocabulary and am now reading Bengali newspapers like Prothom Alo
that use complex language: great for learning Bangla and also for
following the news. In addition to formal vocabulary, my reading of
Prothom Alo and Kazi Nazrul Islam’s poetry is letting me learn
vocabulary that’s rarely used in West Bengal but ubiquitous in
Bangladesh. I’ve learned a lot over the last few weeks, and it’s been
very satisfying.</p>
<p>To further my learning of Spanish, I’ve begun reading El País and
2666 (amazing book) with a lot more vigor. I want to highlight <a
href="https://elpais.com/eps/2026-01-11/boric-el-momento-de-la-reflexion-la-izquierda-que-solo-culpa-al-adversario-esta-condenada-a-diluirse.html">this
article</a> as an especially interesting El País story based on a series
of interviews with Gabriel Boric. Boric is, to my mind, one of the most
inspiring politicians of our times (coherent and logical when speaking,
as president he crushed inflation while also raising minimum wage,
introducing 40 hour work-week, and reforming pension system), and I
liked reading his reflections on politics and also learning about his
various niche interests – turns out the president of Chile is a fan of
both Radiohead and K-pop, in addition to a bunch of other things you
wouldn’t typically associate with a president. That article has lots of
fun Boric trivia while also presenting interesting ideas on the future
of the left and how it can fight the rising tide of far-right
politics.</p>
<p>I’ve also finished Part 2 (the part about Amalfitano) of 2666 and am
really enjoying Part 3! Bolaño writes really well and, more than
directly saying anything, his book is good at creating a feeling of
dread and horror around a place, and conveying the book’s themes through
that characterization. Another super interesting bit of Spanish media is
the 3-part documentary “La Batalla de Chile (The Battle of Chile)
directed by Patricio Guzmán. The movie covers the events leading up to
the 1973 military coup in Chile and the battle between”Poder Popular”
(people’s power) and fascism. It’s a devastating film showing how
collusion between wealthy businessmen, the Chilean military, and the CIA
led to a bloody coup and the destruction of a country’s collective
dreams. More full review coming in a blog post soon (maybe?).</p>
<p>For those curious about my STEM pursuits, I’ve taken a small hiatus,
in part due to burnout; turns out it eventually gets a bit tiring to
spend three-ish years studying college-level math, physics, and computer
science without support from anyone around you! I still love these
subjects, but they require perseverance and energy that I just can’t
muster right now. So for the next few months at least, I will not be
studying physics or math with the same vigor I used to. That shouldn’t
decrease the amount of content on my blog though, since I’m still
engaging with plenty of interesting ideas in other fields. Speaking of
the blog, this ‘second semester free time boost’ will hopefully also let
me write here more often; look forward to that!</p>
<hr />
<p>That mostly sums up recent happenings. If the meteorological gods are
reading this, thanks for the snow; missing four days of school is the
best thing to have happened in a while. As always, feel free to contact
me if you have anything interesting to say (about page has
email+Discord). Farewell until the next post!</p>
