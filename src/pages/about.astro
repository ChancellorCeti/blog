    <h1>About</h1>
    <p>
      I'm a high school student with an interest in mathematics, physics, and
      computer programming. In the realm of mathematics, I mainly focus on
      number theory and combinatorics, so I'll likely move a bit slower through
      anything else. As for physics and computer programming, I pretty much
      dabble in anything I find interesting that could be classified under those
      labels.

        My main hobby is doing problems on a site called <a
          href="https://projecteuler.net">Project Euler</a
        > where I've solved nearly 100 problems. A lot of the content I post here
        is based on things I learned from this site's problems, and it's one of my
        favorite places on the internet.

        I use Rust ðŸ¦€ for most of my programming projects, but I also enjoy C
        socket programming and Julia's data science capabilities. For
        frontend-related work, I use either Svelte or Astro depending on the
        project-- both amazing frameworks.
